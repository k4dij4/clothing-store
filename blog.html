<h1>About Bluum</h1>
<p>
    Blumm was started in 2017 by a group of friends. They attended Bonner Predie highschool and loved fashion.
    They all dreamed of having their own store one day and decided to make their dreams come true by working together and make Blumm. 
    The store got its name to symbolize the bloom of their the fridnships, like a pretty flower blooming in spring.
